### Introduction

This project aims to analyze a loan dataset using Python and various data analysis libraries. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, outlier detection, correlation analysis, and more.

### Data Loading and Initial Exploration

The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploration includes checking the first few rows and the shape of the dataset.

### Data Cleaning

Data cleaning involves handling missing values, duplicate records, and outliers in the dataset. Missing values are imputed using appropriate methods, duplicates are removed, and outliers are addressed.

### Data Visualization

Various visualizations are created to analyze categorical and numeric variables in the dataset. Box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps are used for visualization.

#### Categorical Variables Analysis

Count plots are used to analyze categorical variables with respect to the loan status.

#### Outlier Detection and Handling

Box plots are used to detect and handle outliers in numeric variables such as Loan Amount, Applicant Income, and Loan Amount Term.

#### Numeric Variables Analysis

Histograms and box plots are used to analyze numeric variables such as Loan Amount, Applicant Income, Coapplicant Income, Loan Amount Term, and Credit History.

### Correlation Analysis

A heatmap is created to visualize the correlation between numeric variables in the dataset.

### Conclusion

The README concludes with a summary of the analysis and key findings from the loan dataset.
